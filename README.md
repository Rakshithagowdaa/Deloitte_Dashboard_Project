# Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Project

**Analyzed factory telemetry and employee compensation data to generate actionable business insights using Tableau and Excel.**

## Project Overview

**Machine Telemetry Analysis (Tableau)**
- Analyzed downtime data from 4 Daikibo factories and 9 machine types over a month.
- Created calculated measures (`Unhealthy`) to quantify downtime.
- Built dashboards:
  - Down Time per Factory
  - Down Time per Device Type
- Combined charts in a **dashboard with interactive filters**.
- Screenshot included: `dashboard.png`

**Gender Pay Equality Analysis (Excel)**
- Assessed employee compensation data across factories and job roles.
- Added an **Equality Class** column to categorize scores:
  - Fair (-10 to +10)
  - Unfair (-20 to -10 or 10 to 20)
  - Highly Discriminative (<-20 or >20)
- Insights help identify locations/roles with pay inequality.
- Updated file included: `Equality Table.xlsx`
